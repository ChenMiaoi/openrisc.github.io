# Mailing lists

The OpenRISC [mailing list][] where you can ask your questions around
OpenRISC or get into the discussion with the developers. You can
either just a mail to
[linux-openrisc@vger.kernel.org](mailto:linux-openrisc@vger.kernel.org)
or [subscribe][mailing list] to the list to receive all mails on the
list.

The OpenRISC mailing list is also available on [lore.kernel.lorg](https://lore.kernel.org/openrisc/).
This provides a clean fast interface including a git interface and atom feed for the
list.

# IRC

 * [irc.oftc.net](https://www.oftc.net/) 6697 #openrisc

A few developers hang out on IRC (internet relay chat).  IRC provides a
means to have a real-time conversation with developers to discussion issues
and ideas.  Be aware that community members available on IRC may be operating
in different time zones so response times may vary.

# OpenRISC forum

The [OpenRISC forum][] is maintained on the opencores.org website, and
is a web based discussion forum. Users can use full HTML to format their
messages, and all messages are help in a simple archive online. You can
ask to receive notifications of new messages, by going to “My Account”
(top left of this page, beneath the OpenCores logo) and selecting
“OpenRISC” under the **Subscriptions** section.

A number of [other forums][] address other OpenCores projects (the
Ethernet MAC, PCI, USB etc).
