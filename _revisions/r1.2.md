   - Reserve register `r10` for thread local storage 


## Proposed Additions/Changes

### Reserve R10 for TLS (P1)

Currently `r10` is marked as th callee saved register in the specification, 
however in GCC and libc it is used as thread local storage. 

This proposal is to update the spec to specify that r10 is to be used for
thread local storage.
