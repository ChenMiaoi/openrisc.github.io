As the previous mailing list at librecores.org is not maintained anymore, we
have created a new one project [kernel.org](http://kernel.org) and moved all
members to the new list.  The kernel.org infrastructure is solid and should help
prevent further mailing list stability issues.

Even though this new list is uner the umbrella of the Linux kernel is is still
open for discussion of OpenRISC architecture and other things OpenRISC related.

Please subscribe to the mailing list
[here](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-openrisc) to get involved
in the discussion. You can also ask your question by sending a mail to
[linux-openrisc@kernel.org](mailto:linux-openrisc@kernel.org).
