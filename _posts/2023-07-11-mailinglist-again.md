The previous mailing list at librecores.org served us well for 7 years but is
not maintained anymore due to infrastructure issues and time of the maintainers.
With the help of the mail admins at [vger.kernel.org](http://vger.kernel.org) we have
created a new list and moved all members over.  The kernel.org infrastructure is
solid and should help prevent further mailing list stability issues.

Even though this new list is under the umbrella of the Linux kernel it is still
open to discuss the OpenRISC architecture and other things OpenRISC related.

Please subscribe to the mailing list
[here](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-openrisc) to get involved
in the discussion. You can also ask your question by sending a mail to
[linux-openrisc@vger.kernel.org](mailto:linux-openrisc@vger.kernel.org).
