As the previous mailing list at opencores.org is not fully maintained
anymore, we have created a new one under the umbrella of the community
project [librecores.org](http://librecores.org). By having this
mailing list under control of the active maintainers of the OpenRISC
project we hope to give it much more stability.

Please subscribe to the mailing list
[here](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/openrisc) to get involved
in the discussion. You can also ask your question by sending a mail to
[openrisc@lists.librecores.org](mailto:openrisc@lists.librecores.org).
