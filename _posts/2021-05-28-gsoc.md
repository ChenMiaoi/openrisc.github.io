The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) is a yearly
event which teams open source projects with college students.  Students learn
about technology and the open source community and projects benefit from new
contributions.

As in previous years this year OpenRISC is participating as part of the [FOSSi
foundation](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/2021/03/10/gsoc) project.

This year we the pleasure of working with a talented student Harshita S ([@Harshit49678822](https://twitter.com/Harshit49678822))
on formally verifying the [mor1kx](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx) OpenRISC cpu implementation.

Harshita has already started verification on sub modules on mor1kx starting with
the `mor1kx_cache_lru` module and moving on to the `mor1kx_icache` and `mor1kx_dcache` modules.

You can read the details of the project on [Harshita's
blog](https://harshitha172000.github.io/index.html).  Throughout the
summer project Harshita will provide technical updates on her progress so please be
sure to check back.
