The newlib port for baremetal applications is now entirely upstream.
That means, you can now build libgloss and the newlib libc from the
official repositories.

Unfortunately we missed the deadline for the 2.20 release by just a
few files, but the newlib community recently changed to sub-releases,
so that the 2.20.2 release will contain full or1k support.

Newlib is the C library used in the *or1k-elf* toolchain
(`or1k-elf-gcc`, `or1k-elf-ld`, ..). We maintain the OpenRISC parts in
our <a href="http://www.github.com/openrisc/newlib">own github
repository</a>, that also has some <a
href="http://openrisc.github.io/newlib/">web pages</a>.

You can also find <a
href="http://lis.ei.tum.de/pub-download/openrisc-builds/or1k-elf/release/">official
releases</a> and continuous builds from the <a
href="http://lis.ei.tum.de/pub-download/openrisc-builds/or1k-elf/upstream/">upstream
repositories</a> and <a
href="http://lis.ei.tum.de/pub-download/openrisc-builds/or1k-elf/dev/">development
repositories</a> (newlib and binutils). For more details see the <a
href="http://openrisc.github.io/newlib/">port website</a>.
