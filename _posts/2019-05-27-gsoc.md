The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) is a yearly
event which teams open source projects with college students.  Students learn
about technology and the open source community and projects benefit from new
contributions.

As in previous years this year OpenRISC is participating as part of the [FOSSi
foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org/2019/02/26/gsoc) project.  We have
teamed up with [librecores-ci](https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci),
also of FOSSi, to work with Nancy Chauhan on improving the
[mor1kx's](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx) continuous integration
pipeline.

You can read the details of the project on [Nancy's
blog](http://nancychauhan.in/stories/2019/05/10/Gsoc-2019/).  Throughout the
summer project Nancy will provide technical updates on her progress so please be
sure to check back.
