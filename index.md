Welcome to the project overview of the OpenRISC project. The major
goal of the project it to create free and open computing platforms.
This includes:

- a free and open RISC instruction set architecture with DSP features

- a set of free, open source implementations of the architecture

- a complete set of free, open source software development tools,
  libraries, operating systems and applications

The project is driven by a very active community and has a long
history. This unfortunately lead to scattered and partly outdated
information. The goal of this page is to provide an overview over
active parts of the project and the current development to ease the
enty for newcomers or people seeking basic information. The
information is collected from the following sites where you can find
more information (which can be partly outdated):

- [The OpenRISC pages at opencores.org](http://opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page)

- [openrisc.net](http://www.openrisc.net)

- [The github projects](https://www.github.com/openrisc)
