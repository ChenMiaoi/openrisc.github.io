The aim of the OpenRISC project is to create free and open source
computing platforms.

It aims to provide:

-   a free, open source RISC architecture with DSP features
-   a set of free, open source implementations of the architecture
-   a complete set of free, open source software development tools,
    libraries, operating systems and applications

The OpenRISC 1000 architecture is the first set of specifications for a
family of 32- and 64-bit RISC/DSP processors. Its open and modular
architecture allows a spectrum of chip and system implementations at a
variety of price/performance points for a range of applications.
Designed with emphasis on performance, simplicity, low power
consumption, scalability and versatile implementation, it targets medium
and high performance networking, portable, embedded, and automotive
applications.

### Architecture Specification

The latest version of the architecture specification can be
downloaded [here][] or viewed [online](or1k.html).

More information can be found on the [Architecture Specification][]
page.

### Licensing

The architecture specifications are published under the [GNU General
Public License][] (GPL). The reference implementations in Verilog on
this website are licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License][]
(LGPL). The reference toolchain and operating systems are published
under the license of the upstream software, which is typically the GPL,
but also other open source licenses, such as the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) license.

Third parties are free to create their own proprietary processor
implementations. It is also possible to port proprietary software to the
OpenRISC platform. Use and development of the implementations and
software provided by the project is encouraged.
